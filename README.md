# Accurate-Simulation-of-Vehicular-Ad-Hoc-Networks-Using-Veins-Framework

Vehiclular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANET) are a standardized category of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) tailored
for vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Quite a few simple VANET
protocols have been designed to meet vehicle integration needs,
but some appropriate mobility systems are essential to test the
VANET protocol.In this research work, we propose a VANET
model using TDMA as an access medium to transmit the data
into various resource blocks and for our VANET simulations to
be more accurate, we made an effort to reduce the total time
required to deliver packets among vehicles and RSUâ€™s, while
keeping in mind the data packet loss. For that we ran our network
simulations using Veins, in which SUMO, a road traffic simulator,
was paired with other event based network simulator OMNET++.
